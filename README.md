# NTT-Lab-PJCT
NTT-lab that I completed through Divergence Academy. We built a SMB (small/medium business) network, with a LAN, DMZ, guest network, a Windows domain environment, IIS webserver, Windows FTP server, Win10 workstation, a LAMP webserver running on Ubuntu that is hosting a wiki, and a FortiGate firewall with a VIP for a DMZ webserver.
